# GBAStrobe
Turn your GBA into a strobelight! Inspired by WiiStrobe.

toolbox.h from [Tonc, a tutorial on GBA programming](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/).

.gba files can be run by any popular Game Boy Advance emulator, or flashed to a cartridge to run on real hardware (untested).

## TODO
- [ ] Find the right strobe speed
- [ ] Press buttons to change colors
- [ ] Graphics indicating the above buttons
- [ ] Fix so that the screen displays a solid color all at once instead of in a left to right fashion
